<p>Getting a Tony Award is one of the biggest recognitions in the theater industry. More than an award, it’s a promise that your show is going to thrive. In fact, a study has confirmed that it boosts the revenue of a show by 12%.</p>

<p>However, losing a Tony could be the death sentence for a Broadway show. There are some exceptions, like “A Beautiful Noise”, the Neil Diamond biomusical. It didn’t get a single Tony nomination, however, it’s still running on Broadway, with grosses bigger than some award-winning shows of this season.</p>

<p>The musical, with hits like “Sweet Caroline”, was temporarily affected by the Tonys, with low ticket sales during the summer. However, by fall, it would get its groove back, grossing around $1 million weekly; while Tony Award-winning musicals like “Shucked” would earn around $700k.</p>

<p>The Tonys cast a temporary spell on other shows, like “Some Like It Hot” (winner of four awards), reaching weekly grosses of $1.1 million the month after the ceremony; but gradually, those numbers went down. Sadly, both “Some Like It Hot” and “Shucked” have announced their closing dates.</p>

<p>“Jukebox musicals [like “A Beautiful Noise”] are either tapping on some kind of nostalgia or offering a new form to a familiar product. [The target audience] is not your typical theatergoer, it’s anybody else. That’s what’s making money right now,” thinks Bryan Vargas, who is currently working at the Stephen Sondheim Theater, the house of “& Juliet” (a jukebox musical with nine Tony nominations, zero wins, and constant weekly grosses of around $1 million).
</p>

<p>“A Beautiful Noise” and “& Juliet” didn’t let an award show decide their fate. They have a faithful audience and a box office that speaks for themselves.</p>
